	Oldlinux.org is hosted on a computer provided by my friend NightCat during the past decade. Nothing can fully express my thanks to him. Now due to the forum security issue, I have to stop it temporarily at this moment. I'll keep upgrading it to new veresion and reopen the forum if upgrade process succeed. Now the collections of old stuffs of Linux is still available for you to check and downloading. Thanks everybody who have contribute to the site!
	<LI>2012-10-21<BR>
	A long time passed! I found someone is also interested in the old things. <A
	href="http://virtuallyfun.superglobalmegacorp.com/?author=1"> Neozeed </A> built
	some <A href="http://virtuallyfun.superglobalmegacorp.com/?p=272"> Linux 0.00, 0.1x
	images </A> running on <A href="http://www.qemu.org/"> Qemu emulator </A>. 
	I also put them <A href="http://www.oldlinux.org/Linux.old/qemu-images/"> HERE </a>
	for people to find them easily. Thanks <A
	href="http://virtuallyfun.superglobalmegacorp.com/?author=1"> Neozeed </A>.
	And during this period of time, I also find some valuable old things. The first is
	the source code of <A href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/libs/libc/libc-0.1x/"> lib-0.12 </A>
	for kernel 0.12. The other is the full ancient Linux system using kernel 0.98 patchlevel 1 released early by SLS, 
	<A href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/distributions/SLS/sls-1992.11.zip"> the 0.98pl1 system </A>.
	
  <LI>2010-06-28<BR>Well, since the ebook <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/download/clk011c-2.0.1.pdf">clk011c-2.0.1.pdf </A>on 
  the net, I have already present its next version <A 
  href="http://www.oldlinux.org/download/clk011c-3.0.pdf">clk011c-3.0.pdf</A> 
  here in the last year. This is only a remark of it. Again, it's in Chinese, 
  Sorry!:) 
  <LI>2008-10-21<BR>After the book (based on kernel 0.12) published in Taiwan in 
  2005, the same simplified chinese book published in mainland finally. This new 
  book has nearly 960 pages and thus a little expansive than the book based on 
  kernel 0.11. But all in all, the new book should have less mistakes than the 
  old the version. 
  <LI>2007-06-07<BR>Wow, 10 months passed from the last updating. Hello! Again, 
  we moved to the other new forum (Discuz!) programmed using PHP + MySQL. We 
  have done corrections to the ebook a lot. So we now present the new version of 
  the ebook here: <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/download/clk011c-2.0.1.pdf">clk011c-2.0.1.pdf 
  </A>(V2.0.1). We hope you like it. 
  <LI>2006-08-09<BR>Moving to the new forum smoothly. Updated the Leo BBS 
  package (LB5000XP) to the current version <A 
  href="http://www.leobbs.com/">(LeoBBS X Build060606)</A>. There are lots of 
  new features in this new forum version, including show more than one pic in 
  one post. In the recent time, I plan to change the style of this main page a 
  little :) 
  <LI>2006-06-20<BR>An enhanced version of my book "A Heavily Commented Linux 
  kernel Source Code" has been published by the China Machine Press early this 
  year (2006.1.8). Several new chapters describing the basic information of the 
  kernel have been added, and almost all the source code comments have been 
  rewritten to be more readable &amp; understandable :)<BR>
  <LI>2005-07-30<BR>From 21th to 24th July 2005, I participated the Ottawa Linux 
  Symposium (OLS2005) held in Ottawa Canada. Actually, the conference began from 
  19th to 24th, but I met some problems with my vesa, this caused me 2 days late 
  and missing the chance to meet Linus Toravalds :( <BR>Although I have made a 
  <A 
  href="http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2005/speakers.php?types=TUTORIAL">toturial 
  speech</A> (<A href="http://oldlinux.org/photos/IMG_0056.JPG">photo</A> )at 
  the conference, the main target for me is accturally as a newbie to learn 
  from, to meet the top hackers in the Linux community all of the world. Through 
  the continuing help of Trent Jarvi (photo, from Denver University), I talked 
  to many famous hackers during the conference. These include Theodore Ts'o (<A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/photos/IMG_0088.JPG">photo</A>, <A 
  href="http://thunk.org/tytso/">One of the earlest Linux hackers</A>), Jon 
  "maddog" Hall (<A href="http://oldlinux.org/photos/IMG_0087.JPG">photo</A>, <A 
  href="http://www.li.org/">President of Linux International</A>), Donald Becker 
  (<A href="http://oldlinux.org/photos/IMG_0086.JPG">photo</A>, <A 
  href="http://www.scyld.com/">Network driver programmer</A>), David Jones (<A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/photos/IMG_0100.JPG">photo</A>, <A 
  href="http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/">Current kernel maintainer</A>), Andrew 
  Morton (photo, <A href="http://www.zipworld.com.au/~akpm/">Kernel 
  maintainer</A> ) and many other warm guys in the Linux community. I will show 
  all photos I took in the conference here soon. There are a lot of photos taken 
  by others. These <A href="http://uzix.org/photo/linux/ols/ols2k5/">photos</A> 
  was taken by Joshua Uziel <BR>You can download the conference proceedings from 
  the <A href="http://www.linuxsymposium.org/">Linux symposium website</A>: <A 
  href="http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2005/linuxsymposium_procv1.pdf">Volume 
  1</A> and <A 
  href="http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2005/linuxsymposium_procv2.pdf">Volume 
  2</A>. 
  <LI>2005-03-13<BR>Here is a good paper <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/study/Ref-docs/Linux011-Mem-YuanYi.pdf">"Memory 
  Management under Linux 0.11"</A> written by Yuan Yi. This paper describes all 
  codes in Linux 0.11 relating to memory management. It describes the 
  relationship betweens these code, including the algorithms of allocation &amp; 
  release of memory. 
  <LI>2004-12-17<BR>Linux 0.00 - a fake version :) Since Linus dialed up his 
  MINIX partition of his harddisk, the orignal version of Linux 0.00 lost for 
  ever. I built it under Linux 0.11. Just for fun and for learning something. 
  Two tasks multitasking in level 3. But they are coded as part of the 'kernel' 
  source code, same as task0 &amp; task1 in Linux system. It has got one 'system 
  call' to display character on the screen. Download the <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bochs/linux-0.00-041217.zip">linux-0.00-041217.zip</A> 
  running under bochs, or the <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/kernel/0.00/linux-0.00-041217.tar.gz">source 
  code</A> for it.<BR>"it switched between two processes that printed AAAA... 
  and BBBB... respectively by using the timer-interrupt - Gods I was proud over 
  that" --- Linus Torvalds 
  <LI>2004-09-29<BR>To facilitate the understanding of the source file 
  kernel/blk_drv/ramdisk.c of the Linux 0.11, a integrated image file <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/images/bootroot-0.11">bootroot-0.11</A> 
  has been built, which incoorperates the kernel boot image with a small MINIX 
  rootfs in the same one diskette image file. You can boot the Linux 0.11 system 
  to the shell command prompt with only one diskette. You can also download the 
  bootroot package with experiment parts files from <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bochs/bootroot-0.11-040928.zip">bootroot-0.11-040928.zip</A> 
  in the <A href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bochs/">/Linux.old/bochs/ 
  directory</A>. 
  <LI>2004-09-28<BR>Many people want to boot the Linux 0.11 system from harddisk 
  image file (e.x. hdc-0.11.img). A new Linux 0.11 developement system <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bochs/linux-0.11-devel-040923.zip">linux-0.11-devel-040923.zip</A>, 
  which uses the special boot software <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bin-src/shoelace.tar.Z">shoelace</A> to 
  boot from hd image file, has been built. To boot with the shoelace software, a 
  trick should be played with in the partition table of harddisk image file. So 
  this new Linux 0.11 system got a new hd image file with 127MB in size. 
  <LI>2004-09-02<BR>To accommodate with the experiments in chapter 14 in the 
  ebook, always use the latest image file releases for bochs. The latest 
  Linux-0.11-devel package is <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bochs/linux-0.11-devel-040809.zip">linux-0.11-devel-040809.zip</A>. 

  <LI>2004-05-21<BR>Added bookmark function to the book of v1.9.5 version. 
  corrected page number errors. The book name is still the same. The "big" 
  difference is on the cover page: the revision number changed to V1.9.5, 
  yesterday's is V1.95. 
  <LI>2004-05-20<BR>The new version v1.9.5 of the book (A heavily commented 
  Linux kernel source code) is released today. There are lots of modifications 
  to this new version and a new chapter (ch14) is added too.Thank you all 
  friends that help me to improve the correctness &amp; quality of the book. You 
  can now download this new release <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/download/clk011c-1.9.5.pdf">here (pdf) </A>. You can 
  also download it from in the BBS. BTW, with the help from many kind friends, 
  I'll do my best to translate it into english. Thank you! 
  <LI>2004-05-14<BR>The MINIX-386 system can, now, run under the Bochs emulation 
  system. The priviously released MINIX-386 image file (2004.02.23) can only be 
  used on a real machine. Because the MINIX 1.5 kernel uses a DOS int 0x15 
  function 0x89 to switch to the protected mode in its start.s program, which 
  the Bochs does not support. So I refers to the modification of freebird 
  (wsx00000 at sina.com.cn), add several lines of code to replace the DOS int. 
  Now the <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bochs/MINIX-1.5-040514.zip">MINIX-386</A> 
  can run smoothly under Bochs. Thanks freedird! 
  <LI>2004-05-12<BR>These days I start translating the book into english because 
  some friends intended me to do so. As my english is so poor I am afraid I 
  couldn't finish this tough work. But its a good chance for me to check all 
  commentaries in the book although the translation speed is almost unendurable 
  :) Yes, I did learnt a lot of basics from the book, so I want more people to 
  enjoy it. At least know there is a such book floating around on Internet :) 
  Recently, I have corrected lots of mistakes in the book and preparing to 
  releasse a new revision soon. The new revision will include all the updates in 
  BBS and some new enhanced comments that I not yet published. Thanks for your 
  supporting! 
  <LI>2004-05-11<BR>Distribute a Linux 0.12 snap-shot system built under bochs. 
  This one contains numerous source codes in the /usr/src/ directory. The name 
  is linux-0.12-0402XX-snap.zip andlinux-0.12-0403XX-snap.zip in 
  Linux.old/bochs/ directory (Linux Ancient Resources). The system extracted 
  from bochs is in the directory: Linux.old/distributions/OldLinux/. There only 
  contain the latest one: OldLinux-0.12-20040304.tar.Z 
  <LI>2004-05-05<BR>The <A href="http://kernel.org/">kernel.org</A> is start 
  mirroring the resources of this site.You will be able to download everything 
  from <A 
  href="http://mirrors.kernel.org/oldlinux/">mirrors.kernel.org/oldlinux/</A> 
  not long after. I have done some hardworks rearranging the resources in 
  Linux.old. In order to seperate others from oldlinux resources I put all other 
  stuffs in a directory 'study'. If you find any links in BBS to the 'Linux.old' 
  was broken, then the files must be in the study directory. 
  <LI>2004-04-30<BR>Added a new chapter to the ebook above. "Expriment 
  Envirnment Setup &amp; Usage". This chapter mainly describe the using of Linux 
  0.11 in the Bochs system. There are also contain messages about IO from/too 
  the virtual system (through disk images). You can download this chapter in 
  BBS. 
  <LI>2004-04-23<BR>A couple of weeks ago, I have released the rebuilt 
  Linux-0.11 system. Today I release the new one. The BIG enhancement is that it 
  contains a gcc 1.40 compiling environment. You can use it to compile kernel 
  source in the /usr/src/ directory. The name of this release is <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bochs/linux-0.11-devel-040329.zip">linux-0.11-devel-040329.zip</A>. 
  Also configured for use in bochs environment. The zipped system is in the <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/distributions/OldLinux/">/Linux.old/distributions/OldLinux/</A>directory. 
  Download it &amp; have a try! 
  <LI>2004-04-22<BR>There was a paper titled "LINUX--a free unix-386 kernel" 
  written by Linus Torvalds in October 1991. This 8-paged file was written when 
  linux kernel 0.03 was released. In the paper, Linus states that the LINUX "is 
  meant for hackers/computer science students to use, learn and enjoy....The GNU 
  kernel (Hurd) will be free, but is currently not ready, and will be too big to 
  understand and learn." Now, then, the current Linux system is just like the 
  Hurd at that time. It's too big for the newbies to learn &amp; understand. So, 
  this is why I pick up Linux kernel 0.1x again and rebuild the related running 
  system.... Now you can download and read this <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/Linux-0.01/docs/Linux.pdf">paper</A> 
  again. JUST FOR FUN or learning something from it. Enjoy. 
  <LI>2004-04-19<BR>Due to the unknown problems with the old server, this site 
  was unstable and finally shuted. Now we are moving to another server and 
  reconstruting the site. With the help from Trent Jarvi(www.rxtx.org), a new 
  mirror site has also been created: <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.qbang.org/">oldlinux.qbang.org</A>. Thank you Trent 
  Jarvi! 
  <LI>2004-03-27<BR>I spent a whole day modifying the syntax of kernel 0.11 
  source code for compiling under Redhat 9 system. Now its working with the 
  root-0.11 Image file. The file name is <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/kernel/0.1x/linux-0.11-040327-rh9.tar.gz">linux-0.11-040327-rh9.tar.gz</A>. 
  The diff file is <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/kernel/0.1x/linux-0.11-040327-rh9.diff.gz">here</A>. 
  You can also download the compiled Image file <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/images/Image-0.11-040327-rh9">Image-0.11-040327-rh9</A>. 

  <LI>2004-03-23<BR>Built bash 1.05 with no job control for the orignal 
  bootimage-0.11 image file. The orignal bootimage-0.11 means it was compiled 
  without any modification to the source code of kernel 0.11. This bootimage 
  file <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/images/rootimage-0.11.Z">rootimage-0.11.Z</A> 
  can be downloaded from the Learning materials directory. 
  <LI>2004-03-20<BR>We found an old linux version <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/kernel/linux-0.11-pre.tar.Z">linux-0.11-pre</A> 
  on tytso's archived website. Its release date was 91.12.03. I havn't test it. 
  <LI>2004-03-06<BR>Added mount/umount and mtools in the <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bochs/linux-0.11-040305.zip">linux-0.11</A> 
  system. Now you can mount/umount any MINIX 1.x filesystem and change data from 
  within DOS diskettes. Built 0.11 and 0.12 boot/root image files. Now they are 
  in the <A href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/images/">Learning Materials</A> 
  directory. 
  <LI>2004-03-04<BR>Created a true linux <A 
  href="http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bochs/linux-0.11-040304.zip">kernel 0.11

I am very interested in collecting old linux distributions (prior to 1995). If 
you have any old distros around on CDROM or diskettes, I would appreciate a 
copy. The older the better :-) Note that we are primarily interested in whole 
runnable old systems, not just the kernel source code. <BR>Email:
